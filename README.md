# Machine-Learning-A2
This experiment uses the Chars74K data set. This data set mainly distinguishes numbers 
0-9 and uppercase and lowercase letters A-Z. By using this data set, the accuracy of 
different classifiers on the data set can be obtained. By comparing the accuracy, we can 
analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different classifiers on this data set. This 
experiment uses three classification methods: SVM, Random Forest, deep learning 
CNN, these three methods. Each method uses standardization for preprocessing. It is 
concluded that the CNN method has the highest accuracy and the fastest running speed. 
And after this experiment, it can be supposed that the methods used when processing 
the same data provide experience for future machine learning courses.
